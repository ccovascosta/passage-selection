INTRODUCTION  \nCaffeine (1,3,7 -trimethylxanthine) is a natural purine alkaloid found  in grains, leaves \nand fruits in  more than 60 different types of plants, including coffee ( Coffea  sp.), t ea \n(Thea sinensis ), kola nuts ( Glue acuminate ), yerba mate ( Ilex paraguariensis ), \nguarana ( Paullinia cupana ) and cocoa ( Theobroma cacao ) (PORCI\u00daNCULA  et al., \n2013; MAGUIRE  et al., 2017; SOCALA  et al., 2020 ). Caffeine is also found in a \nvariety of medications and dietary supplements, as well as in popular energy drink s, \nin which caffeine is added to improve its functional properties, promoting a greater  \nsense of  alertn ess and energy by increasing its  stimulating effects on the nervous \nsystem (MEJIA ; RAMIREZ -MARES , 2014; WIKOFF  et al., 2017) .  \nBesides its stimulating pr operties, studies have shown that caffeine acts as a \npotent antioxidant agent since it has been associated with the reduction of oxidative \nstress due to its ability to neutralize Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and  to inhibit \nlipoperoxidation (LPO) in membra nes cells, in  addition to reduce  the production of \u03b2-\namyloid protein in humans with Alzheimer's disease  (KOLAHDOUZAN ; HAMADEH , \n2017; ENDESFELDER  et al., 2019 ; VIEIRA  et al., 2020 ). Indeed , researches  have \nrevealed that antioxidant substances  are associated w ith a low incidence of \ndegenerative diseases, such as:  Alzheimer's, Parkins on's and coronary heart disease  \nby acting to eliminate  reactive species and by increasing the  endogenous antioxidant \ndefenses  (HE et al., 2007; C ARDINAL  et al., 2010; MIKIROVA  et al., 2013 ).  \nHowever,  it is important to mention  that substances with antioxidant properties \ncan promote adverse effects on the body depending on the dosage and frequency of \nuse (NIKI, 2014; KURUTAS, 2016).  It is known that t he complete removal of reactive \nspecies (oxygen/nitrogen and its derivative pro ducts) by supplementation with \nantioxidants can disrupt cell s signaling pathways  (VIANA  et al., 2020) , increasing  the \ndevelopment of  chronic disease s, since reactive species play crucial roles for the \nmaintenan ce of the normal function  of the cells when at cy tostatic levels  contributing  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  135 to viability and basic cellular processes such as cell differentiation and proliferation  \n(RAY et al., 2012; MITTLER , 2017 ). Nevertheless, when at cytotoxic levels, reactive \nspeci es can trigger the oxidative stress process, which is a damage condition that \noccurs to the mitocho ndria, proteins, DNA and lipids, leading to changes in cell s \nfunctions and finally to cells death  (CARAVAN  et al ., 2016; BALDISSERA  et al ., \n2019 ; VIANA  et al., 2020; ABDELMAGEED  et al., 2021 ).  \nResearches h ave shown that the physiological effects of caffeine vary \ndepending on the frequency of use and the doses  of consumption: caffeine can be \nbeneficial when it is taken in moderat e amount of dosage  by healthy a dults (<45 0 \nmg/day), or harmful to hu man health w hen it is consumed in hi gh doses (> 450 \nmg/day) (WIKOFF  et al., 2017; BARCELOS  et al., 2020) . Of note, t he amount of \ncaffeine required to produce adverse effects on the body varies according to weight, \ngender , age, use of  a certain type medication  and the differences in sensitivity, which \nincludes  lifestyle, genetic predisposition to hypertension and diabete s, as well as  \ncaffeine consumption habits  according to age (CARRILLO ; BENITEZ , 2010;  \nTEMPLE  et al., 2017 ; AHSAN ; BASHIR , 2019 ).  \n \n \n \n2. METHODOLOGY  \nIn order  to summarize  these facts , it was carried out a bibliographic survey in the \ndifferent databases ( Science Direct, PubMed , National Library of Medicine ) for the \npurpose of understand ing in general  the benefits  and the risks of caffeine \nconsumption on human b ody. The analysis involves a previous investigative literature  \nstudy  from review and research articles , published in the last two decades, regarding \nto clinical and experimental trials in the laboratory , whi ch allowed  the aggregation of \ndifferent informati on about the benefits and  the harmful effects of caffeine .  \nThis work is comprised by following the establishments of criteria for inclusion \nand exclusion of studies/sampling research to the definition of in formatio n to be \nextracted from selected categoriz ation of studies, as well as the evaluation of studies  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  136 included in the integrative review followed by the interpretation of the results to the \nfinal presentation of the knowledge review/synthesis.  \nThe crite ria for inclusion of stud ies/sampling are consist ed of: full text articles \navailable online; in time horizon, classified as original articles; and primary studies \npublished in English that follow the cost -effectiveness analysis method. Duplicate \nand repeat ed studi es, which were not addressed to the in vestigated topic, were \nexcluded . The information extracted from selected studies  was obtained through  the \nadvanced search method  by using the titles, abstract s and keywords category,  such \nas \"Caffeine\", \u201cBenefi ts of Caffeine for Human Health\", \"Caffeine C onsu mption\" and \n\"Adverse Effects of Caffeine on the Body \u201d.  \n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  \n \n3.1. Caffeine Consumption and Health  \nCaffeine is the most consumed  psychostimulant  worldwide, it is being ingested more \noften in bev erages such as coffee, teas and popular energy dr inks (LIU et al., 2017; \nAHSAN; BASHIR, 2019) . It is estimated that approximately 80% of the world \npopulation consumes caf feinated products every day, and around  90% of adults in \nNorth America drink more than  400 million cups of coffee daily  (ALMOSAWI  et al., \n2018; DE PAULA ; FARAH, 2019 ). Energy drinks occupy a significant portion of daily \ncaffeine consumption, especially in the United States, given its prevalence and \npopularity  (HECKMAN  et al., 2010; BRANUM  et al., 2014 ; WIKOFF  et al., 2017 ).  \nHowever, most  of the caffeine consumed daily in the US is imported in the \nform of coffee and tea in comparison to cocoa, kola nuts and synthetic caffeine, \nwhich occupy a smaller portion of these imports since they contai n reduced amounts \nof caffeine (FULGONI  et al., 2015). In the young population, there is an increase in \nthe caffeine consumed content , predominantly through soft drinks and coffee  as \nchildren become adolescents  (AHLUWALIA et al., 2014; TEMPLE et al., 2017).  In \nthis sense , a study performed by Ahluwalia an d Herrick (2015) showed that \nthereabout  75% of children and adolescents in the USA, from 6 to 19 years of age, \nconsume an average of 38 mg  of caffeine per day, in addition to  an average  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  137 consumption of 25 mg  of of caffeine per day in children aged 2 to 12 y ears old, and \n50 mg/day in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years  old.  \nCorroborating this fact, Drewnowski and Rehm (2016) reported that among \nchildren and adolescents the highest consumption of caffeine occurs at  ages 9 to 13 \nyears, in a consumption of up to 26  mg/day, and at age  14-19 years  old, reaching 61 \nmg of caffeine per day. Similarly, studies have shown that the average caffeine \nintakes increase  from 50 mg/ day in childhood ( 2 to 11 years old) to 180 mg/ day in \nadulthood, due to chang es in consumption habi ts by  adults  since they adopt  a more  \nregular pattern compared to children (FITT et al., 2013; AHLUWALIA  et al., 2014 ; \nBRANUM  et al., 2014).  \nFood sources of caffeine change  as well . According to Wikoff et al., (2017), \nthe adult population intake s caffeine mainly through the consumption of coffee and \ntea, while children and adolescents intake caffeine through the consumptio n of soft \ndrinks and chocolates.  Coffee is one of the products that generally contains t he \nhighest concentrations of caffeine ( from 3 to 350/400 mg) compared to tea and some \nenergy drinks, as well as solid foods in general suc h as chocolate, which contains \nfrom 1 to 6 mg of caffeine per serving only ( MEJIA; RAMIREZ -MARES , 2014) . \nIndeed , choco late and other cocoa -based foods have a small con tribution of caffeine \nto the diet, since it offers  no significant stimulating effects on the nervous system \n(TEMPLE  et al., 2017).   \nIt should be noted that there is a significant variation in the conc entrati on of \ncaffeine within the same category of drinks . For example, it is estimated that a \nstandard cup of coffee (ground coffee) of 240 ml or 8 oz (short for the English unit of \nmeasure Ounce for mass or weight) has an average 100 mg of caffeine ( HECK;  \nMEJIA , 2007).  Of interest, a study conducted by McCuske r et al., (2013) analyzed \nthe caffeine content in 20 different types of coffee purchased from coffee shops in the \nUnited States, reporting that the amount of caffeine in ground co ffee can vary from \n76 to 112  mg/8 oz.  Even greater variations in the amount o f caffeine (33 to 400 mg) \ncan be seen in energy drinks in general (MEJIA; RAMIREZ -MARES, 2014).  \n \n3.2. Beneficial Effects of C affeine   \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  138 In low doses (<200 mg/day), studies reported that caffeine consumption was abl e to \nimprove mood, alertness and  to increase locomotors  performance, as well as the \nsense of attention and the speed in which the information is processed  (LIU et al., \n2017; DE PAULA; FARAH, 2019; ONAOLAPO ; ONAOLAPO , 2020 ). Furthermore , it \nhas been reporte d that regular caffeine consumption  is related to  a lower risk of \ndeveloping neurodegenerative diseases , such as Al zheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and \nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) , because it acts  as a neuroantioxidant on nervous system \n(Table 1) (KI; LI, 2014; KOLAHDO UZAN ; HAMADEH, 2017; REN ; CHEN, 2020; \nHONG et al., 2020 ).  \nIn this view, studies conducted on the role of caffeine in the management of \nthese neurological disorders highlighted that this substance  has a strong antagonistic \neffect  against the adenosine A2A receptor and a forceful  agonistic effect against \nnuclear -related factor -2 (Nrf -2), regulating  the cellular homeostasis at the brain by \nreducing oxidative stress and regulating the balance  of the accumulation of \u03b1-\nsynuclein in PD, in addition to reduc e the production of \u03b2-amyloid protein in humans \nwith AD (RIVERA -OLIVER ; D\u00cdAZ -R\u00cdOS, 2014; KOLAHDOUZAN ; HAMADEH, 2017 ; \nENDESFELDER  et al., 2019; IKRAM et al., 2020).   \nModerate doses of caffeine (around 200 -300 mg/day) may have  a \nconsiderable role in weight loss b y acting on the metabolism rate  since its \nmetabol ites can trigger inhibition of critical enzymes on the systemic metabolism and, \nin turn, to modulate lipid and glucose metabolisms (CANO -MARQUINA et al., 2013; \nBARCELOS  et al ., 2020). It was also demonstrate d that caffeine acts  in the \nprevention of certain  types of cancer, including  endometrial, prostate, rectal and liver \ncancer , when it is ingested  by healthy humans in moderate doses  through complex \ncellular signaling mechanisms (Table 1) (GAPSTUR  et al., 2017; AHSAN ; BASHIR, \n2019; INOUE ; TSUGANE , 2019 ; ISMAIL et al., 2021 ).  \nIn this context, meta -analysis of  cohort , observational and prospective  studies \nhighlighted in a review work carried out by Poole et al ., (2017) showed a lower \nincidence of several typ es of cancer for low  doses  to moderate doses of c affeine \ncontent in coffee , reporting that caffeine  consump tion was associated with a weak  \nrisk of  developing  prostate cancer  and oral cancer (WANG et al., 2016),  endometrial \ncancer  (ZHOU  et al ., 2015),  leuke mia (Y U et al ., 2011), melanoma  (YEW  et al.,  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  139 2016), non-melanoma skin cancer  (CAINI et al., 2017)  and liver cancer  (BRAVI  et al., \n2016), with significant linear dose -response relations indicating benefits for health.   \nOf relevance , a meta -analysis study  has showed that  a high consumption \nversus a low co nsumption of decaffeinated coffee was associated with a lower risk of \nlung cancer  (TANG  et al., 2016) , evidencing that we need to focus on  other bioactive \ncompounds besides the  caffeine . However, in people w ho smoke, the risk of \ndeveloping lung cancer must  be associated with the excessive consumption of \ncaffeine due to the vicious habit of drinking coffee before smoking ( XIE et al., 2016; \nGALARRAGA  et al., 2016).  \nResearches have examined the effects of low to moderate  caffeine doses (5 -\n13 mg/kg body mass) o n exercise and sport situation . At low dos es (<3 mg/kg body \nmass, ~200 mg ), caffeine can improve the locomotors performance during exercises , \nthe enhancing  of vigilance, alertness, mood and the cognitive pro cesses ( SPRIET, \n2014). Of importance, motivation  and caffeine consumption habits can influence  the \ncognition response and  the general performance s during and after exercises \n(SHABIR  et al., 2018) , as well as during the sex and age on caffeine ergogenicity,  \ntherefore , causing  modifying  effects of genotype  (PICKERING; GRGIC, 2019).   \nAccording to Burke (2008), the beneficial performance of caffeine can be seen \nwith moderate amounts (~3 mg.kg -1 body mass), but these benefits are likely to \noccur across a range o f sports, including endurance events, stop -and-go events, and \nsports involving sustained high -intensity activity, for example swimm ing, rowing, and \nmiddle and distance running races. On the other hand, as reported by Gues et al., \n(2021), high doses of caff eine (e.g. 9 mg/kg) are associated with a high in cidence of \nside-effects and they do not seem to be required in order to  elicit an ergogenic effect \nin a wide range of aerobic and a naerobic sport -specific actions.  \nStudies  in the toxic -pharmacological area have shown that caffeine is able to \nreduce the lev els of reactive species and pro -inflammatory molecules , such as \nTumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF) and interleukins (IL) , which acting on cell s signaling \npathways that trigger inflammatory processes  (AMER et al., 2017; WILLSON , 2018; \nBARCELOS  et al ., 2020 ; IKRAM  et al., 2020 ). Moreover, caffeine can act as an \nantioxidant molecule, being  capable of reducing  the levels of lipoperoxidation  (LPO) \nin cell lipid membranes that may cause, in a last instance, consequent dam age to \nDNA, proteins and mitochondria , resulting from the oxidative stress proc ess (Table 1)  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  140 (PERGOLIZZI et al., 2018; VIEIRA  et al., 2020) , a condition characterized by a  shift \nin the balance of the endogenous  antioxidant defense mechanisms  due to the hig h \nproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)  (VRAILAS -MORTIMER et al., 2012; \nDA SILVA et al., 2018; V IANA et al., 2020 ; ABDELMAGEED et al., 2021 ).  \nAdditionally, caffeine is able to act as a regulatory factor in the cell cycle that \nmodulates the DNA repai r system , and as an immunomodulatory substance that \ninteracts with specific receptors as well as  cytokines,  thereby  modulating the immune \nsystem through mediation of its effects on T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, natural \nkiller of cells and macrophages  (CUI et al., 2020).  Interestingly, Lipton et al., (201 7) \nreported the role of caffeine also as an analgesic adjuvant in the acute treatment of \nprimary heada che with over -the-counter drugs, and in the migraine condition . It was \nfound that the combination of caff eine in doses of \u2265100 mg and analgesic \nmedication s, including acetaminophen, ace tylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen have  \nshowed a significant improve ment  in the treatment of patients with tension -type \nheadache and migraine . \nDue to its anti-inflammatory effects , caffeine can also exert potent effects as a \nclinical preventive medicine for other types of injuries, such as , bronchopulmonary \ndysplasia  as demonstrated by Zhao et al., (2019) .

In the nervous system,  the caffeine can cause  changes in the brain \nneurotransmitter levels by  triggering behavioral and neurochemical changes \nassociated with antagonism of inhibitory presynaptic adenosine recepto rs, as well as \nalteration in the number of thes e receptors, releasing  an uptake and turnover  of \nneurotransmitters  (BARCELOS  et al., 2020).   \nAdenosine is a molecule involved in numerous biochemical pathways, mainly \nin the transfer of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) and cell \nsignaling, in addition to being a neuromodulator that can promote sleep iness , \naffect ing the memory and the learning  process  (GOMES  et al., 2011). There are \nseveral types of cognate receptors in  which adenosine can act, notably A1, A2a, A2b \nand A3 , which are proteins coupled to G protein ( RIBEIRO ; SEBASTI\u00c3O, 2010; \nTEMPLE  et al., 2017 ). Caffeine can cause sleep ing disturbance because it has the \npotential to occupy the sites of the adenosine receptors, in special  A1 and A2a , since \nboth caffeine and adenosine have a similar molecular structure with a kind of \ncomparable double bond ring (F ISONE  et al., 201 4) (Figure 1) . \n  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  143 \n \n  \n \n  Figure 1 - Similarities between the chemical structures of 1,3,7 -trimethylxanthine \n(caffeine) and a denosine.  \nSource: Fisone et al., (2014).  \n \n \n \nStudies have reported that caffeine can cause a state of dysfunctional \nexcitation in the nervous system, leading to sleep ing disturbances , in amounts above \n450 mg of caffeine/day  (Table 2) (WATSON  et al., 2016; ONAOLAPO; ONAOLAPO,  \n2020).  In children, clinical trial  studies highlighted in a review work conducted by  \nWikoff et al., (2017)  have shown  that the excess of caffeine  alters normal sleep ing \npatterns, affecting the health y development of children as they grow  up. Hence, i t \nmust  be established  that they should consume lower amounts  of caffeine  or equal to \n2.5 mg/kg body weight/ day.  \nMoreover, researches have also  reported that high doses of caffeine ( >500 \nmg/day) can cause high levels of tension, nervousness, i rritability, nausea, \npalpitations and restlessness in healthy humans (Table 2) (LIU et al ., 2017; \nWILLSON , 2018). In this sense, high doses of caffeine c an lead to an anxiety \ndisorder making individuals with pre -existing anxiety disorder more susceptible t o the \neffects of moderate doses of caffeine (200 -300 mg/day) than individuals who do  not \nhave any depression symptoms  (WANG  et al., 2016; DE PAULA ; FARAH , 2019).  \nThe effects of caffeine r egarding cardiovascula r disorders show  that t he \nconsumption of low to  moderate amount of caffeine per day is associated with a \nreduced risk of cardiovascular disease (W ENG et al., 2020 ; SOCALA et al., 2020 ), \nbut an acute caffeine intake (>500 mg/day) can stimulates a mo dest increase in \nblood pressure  triggering supraventric ular tachycardia perhaps due to the  increased \nof intracellular calcium concen trations, norepinephrine releasing  and sensitization of 1,3,7 -trimethylxanthine        Adenosine   \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  144 dopamine receptors (CANNON et al., 2011; CHRYSANT , 2017; TURNBULL et al., \n2017).  In addition, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillat ion and coronary disease also have been \ndetected  in healthy  and hypertensive individuals or with historic of cardiovascular \nproblems (Table 2) (HARTLEY  et al., 200 0; O\u2019KEEFE  et al., 2013; BODAR  et al., \n2019). Other factors that can influence the developmen t of these cardiovascular \ndisorders  as well as their aggravation  by the excessive  consumption of caffeine  are \nobesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, tobacco smoking and alcohol ( JOHN , 2020).  \nDiffer ent studies have reported the negative association of caffeine \nconsumption through coffee  with metabolic, gastrointestinal, and liver disorders  \n(AWAAD  et al., 2011; ARNAUD, 2011; MEREDITH  et al., 2013 ; KENNEDY  et al., \n2016; H ODGE  et al., 2017; M ANSOUR  et al., 2020 ). Most of these d isorders were \nreported in the e nzymatic systems responsible for the metabolism of caffeine in the \nbody, in particular the cytochrome P450 oxidase system, mainly  by the enzyme \nCYP1A2  present in the liver and other tissue s, including the brain (Table 2) . Several \ncytochrome P450 (CYP) isof orms are implicated in caffeine demethylation and \nhydroxylation (CYP1A2, CYP1A1, CYP2E1 and CYP3A), but the liver enzyme \nCYP1A2 is in charge of  the clearance of caffeine in  the human body  (SOCALA  et al., \n2020) . Otherwise, the pharmacokinetics process of ca ffeine is not affected by the \nhepatic first -pass effect, and its elimination is regarded as a first -order process \ndescribed by a one -compartment open model system within th e intake range of 2 \u201310 \nmg/kg ( NEWTON  et al., 1981 ; BLANCHARD ; SAWERS , 1983 ).  \n \nTable  2 - Main a dverse effects of caffeine  on human body . \n \nSystem  \n  \nAdverse effects  \n Dose and \nfrequency of use \u00b9  \nReferences  \n \n \n \n \n \nNervous system   \nDysfunctional excitement, sleep ing \ndisorder s, nervousness and \nirritability; High neurostimulant \neffects;  Headache and difficulty \nconcentrating; Contributes to risk of \ndeveloping neurodegenerative \ndiseases   \n \n \n \n>450 mg/g/day  Nawrot et al., (2003 ) \nFerr\u00e9 ( 2008 ) \nCosta et al., (2010 ) \nWatson et al., (2016 ) \nTemple et al., (2017 )  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  145   Wikoff et al., (2017 ) \nKolahdouzan and \nHamadeh (2017 ) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCardiovascular \nsystem   \n \n \n \nIncrease in blood pressure  causing \nhypertension  and increase in heart  \nrate; arrhythmia, atrial fibrilla tion \nand coronary heart disease   \n \n \n \n \n>500 mg/g/day  \n Pelchovitz and Goldb erger \n(2011 ) \nMesas  et al., (2011 ) \nCano -Marquina et al., \n(2013 ) \nCheng  et al., (2014 ) \nGrosso et al., (2016 ) \nChrysant  (2017 ) \nTurnbull et al., (2017 ) \nWillson ( 2018 ) \nBodar et al., (2019 ) \nDe Paula and Farah ( 2019 ) \n \n \nHepatic system   \nCytotoxicity and an increased of the \ndetoxification load; a considerab le \nclearance reducing, and prolonged  \nhalf-life elimination  \n  \n \n>400 mg/g/day   \nArnaud ( 2011 ) \nPerera et al., (2013 ) \nCheng et al., (2014 ) \n \n \nGastrointestinal \nsystem   \nNausea, vomiting, abdominal pain \nand diarrhea .  \n> 450 mg/g/day  Devies et al., (2012 ) \nDoherty a nd Smith ( 2014 ) \nWillson ( 2018 ) \n1- Average values based on the variation in the amount of caffeine ingested by healthy adults reported \nin the different studies cited.  \nIn pregnancy, studies have investigated the relationship between the \nassociation of high -dose s of caffeine intake s (>500 m g/day) by pregnant women and \nthe underlying complications of fetal development, indicating an increasing in the  \nincidence of spontaneous abortion, fetal growth restriction, mental retardation and \ncongenital malformations, as well as low birthweight  babies  (CARE STUDY G ROUP,   \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  146 2008; MORGAN  et al., 2013; WIKOFF  et al., 2017; GASKINS et al., 2018) . In this \ncontext, James (2020) exanimated the evidence of the association between maternal \ncaffeine consumption and the negative preg nancy outcomes t hrough a narrative \nreview study , which summarized  that the maternal caffeine consumption is reliably \nassociated with major negative pregnancy outcomes, in which caffeine consumption \nfrom moderate to high levels increased  the risk of fetal c omplications for all \npregnancy women, associating with stillbirth, low birth weight  babies  and/or small for \ngestation al age.  \nGiven the effects that caffeine may have on brain development, it is \nrecommend ed that pregnant women reduce  the caffein e consumpti on during \npregnancy in amounts less than  or equal to 300 mg of caffeine/ day (equivalent to 5 \nmg/kg of weight body/day for a 70 kg person , about two or three small cups of coffee \nper day ) (HECKMAN et al ., 2010 ; MEREDITH  et al ., 2013 ; MEJIA ; RAMIREZ -\nMARES , 2014; CARO; FAST , 2020 ). Accordingly, it is important that women receive \nsound evidence -based advice about potential caffeine -related harm (JAMES , 2020).  \nMoreover, t he association between the increasing of  caffeine consumption, \nparticularly from coffee, and  the relative risk of develop ing type 2 diabetes mellitus \nwere  also investigated in s everal  studies ( AGARDH  et al., 200 4; BIDEL  et al., 2008; \nDING et al., 2014; JIANG  et al., 2014 ; CHRYSANT , 2017 ; SOCALA  et al., 2020 ). The \nrisk of developing this metabolic  syndrome is notably  associated with the high \namounts of caffeine consumption  in long terms , especially in predisp osed individuals \n(SHANG  et al., 2016).  Nonetheless, t he risk is generally not very high at low caffeine \nconcentrations (170 to 200 mg/day), it even enhances the physiological functioning of \npancreatic beta cells and it also improves the  glucose tolerance ( SANTOS ; LIMA, \n2016; AHSAN ; BASHIR, 2019; SAID  et al., 2020 ).  \nHowever, it is important to take into consideration  other bioactive compounds \npresent in coffee, such as trigonelline, cafeic and chlorogenic acids , which can alter \nthe effect of glucose absorption by the  liver and the insulin sensitivity in pre -diabetics \npatients (HECKMAN  et al., 2010; CANO -MARQUINA et al., 2013; MIRMIRAN  et al., \n2018). Consumption of decaffeinated coffee also seemed to have similar \nassociations of comparable magnitude when it is intake in higher doses by \nsusceptible individuals (D ING et al., 2014; P OOLE  et al., 2017)  (Figure 2 ). \n  \n \nISSN: 16799 844 \u2013 InterSciencePlace \u2013 International Scientific J ournal                     Page  147  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2  - Flowchart correlating the association among pregnancy, type 2 diabetes \nmellitus and caffeine consumption.  \n \nFinally, we must analyze those individuals who want to stop consuming \ncaffeine , because it is necessary to do this progressively, since  the sudden cessation \nof regular caffein e consu mption produces symptoms, such a s headache, drowsiness, \nlethargy, fatigue, labor difficulties, a decreasing  in the well-being  state , a drop in \nblood pressure and an increasing in the  blood flow in the brain that are associated \nwith the Caf feine Withdrawal Syndrome (CWS ) (LADER  et al ., 1996; G\u00d6KCEN ; \n\u015eANLIER , 2017; RODDA et al., 2020) . The intensity and persistence  of these \nsymptoms vary according to the de gree of sensitivity to caffeine and  among other \nfactors  previously listed. As CWS  occurs due to the sudden interruption  of caffeine \nintake  by individuals who usually consume it daily through products containing \ncaffeine, the symptoms can  be avoided if this intake is gradually decreased \n(PHILLIPS -BUTE; LANE, 1998 ; DE PAULA ; FARAH, 2019). Despite the withdrawal \nsymptoms previously described, the caffeine is not listed in the category of \nsubstances that can cause addiction  (DE PAULA ; FARAH , 2019) .

CONCLUSIONS  \nIn sum , the literature reviewed  in this study  suggests that depending on the \nfrequency and the dosage of caffeine consumption, it can cause a beneficial effect or \nan adverse  physiological effect  on the human body. When it is ingested in moderate \namounts (<450 mg of caffeine per day) by healthy adults, caffeine  can act as an \nantioxidant, anti -inflammatory and as a regulator for  certain important metabolic \npathways. However, when it is consumed in high doses ( >450 mg of caffeine per \nday),  caffeine can be harmful to  the human health  by contributing to the developm ent \nof diverse physiological changes, mainly related to the nervous, cardiovascular , renal  \nand hepatic  systems.   \nIt is worth mentioning that the amount of  caffeine required to produce adverse \neffects on the body also varies according to some factors such a s: weight, gender , \nage, the use of certain types of medications and the difference in sensitivity . Those \nfactors also include  people at risk group , for instance,  hypertensive  people , diabetic s \nor people with disorders in  the nervous system. Nevertheless , further  research es are  \nneeded in order to add more information to  these emerging concerns , and to provide \na greater empirical support for the recommendations related to the caffe ine \nabsorption, distribution, metabolism and consumption .  \n \n \nAcknowledgments:  The corresponding  author  of this work  appreciates the availability \nof the collaborators for carrying out part of the research of scientific articles in the \ndatabases and for reviewing English  normative grammar.  \n \nConflicts of interest : The authors declare th at they have no conflict of interest . \n \nREFERENCES  \nABDELMAGEED, N. ; TWAFIK, W.
