In vitro and animal studies, and clinical trials employing putative intermediaryindicators of disease, particularly biomarkers of oxidative stressstatus, provide strong evidence that green tea polyphenols(GTP) may play a role in the risk and pathogenesis of severalchronic diseases, especially cardiovascular disease and cancer,and related pathologies. In addition, several studies suggest abeneficial impact of green tea intake on bone density, cognitivefunction, dental caries and kidney stones, among other effects[4–5]. Over the last years, numerous epidemiological and clin-ical studies have revealed several physiological responses togreen tea which may be relevant to the promotion of health andthe prevention or treatment of some chronic diseases. However,the results from epidemiological and clinical studies of therelationship between green tea consumption and human healthare mixed. For example, conflicting results between humanstudies may arise in part, from ignoring socioeconomic andlifestyle factors as well as by inadequate methodology to definetea preparation and intake [2,4–7]. Foodstuff can be regarded as functional if it is satisfactorily demonstrated to affect beneficially one or more target functionsin the body, beyond adequate nutritional effects in a way whichis relevant to either the state of well-being and health or thereduction of the risk of a disease [5,8–9], so green tea has beenproved to have functional properties and at present, its con-sumption is widely recommended. The aim of this article is to revise the most recent studies on green tea beneficial effects and to evaluate its",

In general, their consumption should be reduced in people with anemia due to the possible interaction of tea tannins with Fe and especially in the case of megaloblastic anemia.28 The presence of aluminum may be rather elevated in some types of tea because of a notable influence of cultivated and processed soil levels.16 On the other hand, drinking too hot tea may increase the r isk of esophageal cancer.118 Finally, a very high consumption of green or white tea would lead to excessive intake of flavonoids, which would give rise to the formation of ROS that would cause damage in DNA, lipid membranes and proteins.117 4. CONCLUSIONS The health e ffects associated with the consumption of green and white teas include protection against hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, promotion of oral health, control of body weight, antibacterial and antiviral activity, protection against UV ra diation, increase of bone mineral density, and antifibrotic and neuroprotective properties, among others. These e ffects are related to their high content of polyphenols and in particular catechins, where EGCG stands out due to its high antioxidant potentia l, which even surpasses that found in vitamins C and E. The e ffects are also related to the presence of caffeine and L -theanine, an amino acid with interesting biological effects. Green and white teas may also be a source of some minerals, including Mn and F. Recent studies indicate that the",

            "passage": "studies have revealed that green and white teas have positive biological activities against chronic diseases such as cancer, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative pathologies, among others. These protective properties are related to the potent antioxidant and anti- inflammatory activities of xanthic bases (ca ffeine and theophylline), essential oils (green tea and white tea are the two types of tea with the highest content), minerals (F, Mn, Cr), L -theanine and, mostly, catechins and other phenolic compounds.12,32 Caffeine acts on the central nervous system by stimulatin g attention, facilitating the association of ideas and reducing the sensation of fatigue. Some of the e ffects caused by ca ffeine are influenced by the content of theophylline, which also has inotrope, vasodilator, diuretic and bronchodilator action.12,25 Essential oils, which are abundant in green tea and white tea, facilitate digestion.12 Catechins and in particular EGCG have low bioavailability when orally ingested.33 Only a small percentage is absorbed at the level of the small intestine and passes into the bloodstream, reaching maximum plasma concentrations between 1 –3 hours after consumption. Some authors indicate that the secondary metabolites derived from the intake of flavonoids could be detected in blood and urine. For that reason, it is thought tha t the observed biological e ffects are possibly due to these secondary metabolites rather than the flavonoids themselves, which are detected in their original form in very low quantities.34 The bioavailability of phenolic tea compounds has been",
