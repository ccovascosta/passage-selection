While no single food item can be expected to provide a significant effect on public health, it isimportant to note that a modest effect between a dietary com-ponent and a disease having a major impact on the mostprevalent causes of morbidity and mortality, i.e., cancer andheart disease, should merit substantial attention. Taking all thisinto account, it would be advisable to consider the regularconsumption of green tea in Western diets. ACKNOWLEDGMENT We thank M.J.

This aspect is important for patients with renal failuresbecause Al can be accumulated by the body, resulting inneurological diseases; it is therefore necessary to control theintake of food with high amounts of this metal [1]. The possibleconnection between elevated tissue Al content and problemssuch as osteomalacia and neurodegenerative disorders (i.e.,Alzheimer’s disease) has awakened interest in Al intake viadiet [158]. Minoia et al. [159] found concentrations of Al in green and black teas (as infusions) accounting for 431–2239 /H9262g/L, whereas in coffee they found lower concentrations (9.1– 30.8/H9262g/L). In a study carried out in Italy, these authors estimated the tea contribution to the total Al dietary intake as665 /H9262g/week (considering a weekly mean consumption of 2 cups). According to several authors, Al dietary intake must notexceed 6 mg/day in order to avoid potentially toxic levels[160]. Lo ´pez et al. [158] evaluated Al presence in food and beverages widely consumed in Spain, and found that Al levelsin tea ranged from 43.42 to 58.04 /H9262g/g referred to dry weight of the solid product, and from 13.91 to 27.45 /H9262g/L in the corresponding infusions; levels in coffee samples varied be-tween 25.6 and 29.08 /H9262g/g referred to dry weight of the solid product, and from 7.12 to 9.14 /H9262g/L in the corresponding infusions. Costa et al. [1] observed that black tea contains nearly six-fold more Al than green tea, and the",

In general, their consumption should be reduced in people with anemia due to the possible interaction of tea tannins with Fe and especially in the case of megaloblastic anemia.28 The presence of aluminum may be rather elevated in some types of tea because of a notable influence of cultivated and processed soil levels.16 On the other hand, drinking too hot tea may increase the r isk of esophageal cancer.118 Finally, a very high consumption of green or white tea would lead to excessive intake of flavonoids, which would give rise to the formation of ROS that would cause damage in DNA, lipid membranes and proteins.117 4. CONCLUSIONS The health e ffects associated with the consumption of green and white teas include protection against hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, promotion of oral health, control of body weight, antibacterial and antiviral activity, protection against UV ra diation, increase of bone mineral density, and antifibrotic and neuroprotective properties, among others. These e ffects are related to their high content of polyphenols and in particular catechins, where EGCG stands out due to its high antioxidant potentia l, which even surpasses that found in vitamins C and E. The e ffects are also related to the presence of caffeine and L -theanine, an amino acid with interesting biological effects. Green and white teas may also be a source of some minerals, including Mn and F. Recent studies indicate that the",

        "Moreover, it would be interesting to carry out additional studies with a habitual consumption extended in time more than studies designed with a very high consumption during a short period of time. For instance, cancer studies generally compare a low or no consumption versus a high consumption (even 10 cups per day). Regarding the research carried out with extracts, a better control of factors such as dose or formulation is necessary. This fact is essential in order to better identify the product tested and the population which it can exercise the benefit in. In conclusion, further research and well -designed additional studies (observational, epidemiological and nutritional Pastoriza et al. / Food & Function 8 (2017) 2650-2662 pag. 9 intervention) are needed to define the current magnitude of health e ffects of tea, to establish the range of safety of the consumption associated with beneficial effects and to elucidate the possible mechanisms of action as a basis for future nutritional claims related to both green and white teas. Green and white teas have a number of advantages that make them a very good alternative to other beverages which are widely consumed and less healthy. They are beverages with a pleasant flavor (flowers and fruit aroma with low levels of bitterness and astring ency) that are even commercialized flavored with other fruits and flowers. They are popular beverages, socially well accepted, economical, safe and consumed daily by hundreds of millions of people in the five",

There appeared to be no effect on the high consumers, but the low consumers regained sig- nificantly less weight (P < .01) than participants receiv - ing placebo.17 A 12-week double-blind controlled trial compared the effects of a green tea extract beverage high in catechins with a lower catechin placebo beverage in 240 Japanese adults who were obese.18 The results showed that the active treatment group had greater reductions in body weight, body mass index, body fat ratio, body fat mass, and waist and hip circumference ( P < .05).18 Cardiovas CUlar F UnCtion Epidemiologic studies suggest that green tea intake is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, but the mechanisms remain uncertain. Clinical trials show inconsistent results in the effect of green tea on lipid levels, blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. A prospective cohort study of more than 40,000 Japanese adults found that green tea consumption was inversely associated with cardiovascular disease mor- tality.10 Women who consumed five or more cups per day had a 31 percent lower risk of dying from cardio - vascular disease.10 Participants who consumed five or more cups per day had a significantly reduced incidence of stroke.10sort : KEy rEComm Endations F or P raCtiCE Clinical recommendationEvidence rating References Ointment derived from green tea appears to be effective in the treatment of genital warts.

A small controlled trial followed 60 patients with high-grade prostate intraepi - thelial neoplasia.12 Patients were grouped randomly to receive green tea catechins extract (200 mg three times a day) or placebo for one year.12 Nine cancers were found in the placebo group, whereas only one cancer was detected in the green tea group.12 Another small clinical trial found no benefit from the use of green tea extract (500 mg per day for two to four months)13; however, a recent epidemiologic study of nearly 50,000 Japanese men found a dose-dependent relationship between green tea consumption and a reduction in the risk of advanced prostate cancer.14WEiGht mana GEmEnt Several small clinical trials have investigated the effect of green tea on weight loss and weight management.15,16 Some controlled trials suggest a benefit from green tea, whereas others do not. None of the studies demonstrate persistent effects. In one randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial, investigators tracked the effects of green tea in 76 men and women who were overweight or obese.17 The effects of a green tea/caffeine mixture (two capsules, each containing 45 mg of EGCG and 25 mg of caffeine, taken before meals) on persons who habitually consumed large amounts of caffeine (more than 300 mg per day) were compared with the effects on those who consumed small amounts of caffeine.
