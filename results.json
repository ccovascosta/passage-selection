E fforts are being made to make LLMs more explainable to promote user trust and to ensure responsible AI usage. Understanding the logic behind LLMs’ responses is essential for fostering trust and ensuring they align with human values and legal standards. Privacy Concerns: Privacy concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs) have escalated with their growth in complexity and size, particularly around data sharing and potential misuse. There is a risk of malicious content creation, filter bypass, and data privacy issues, especially in e-commerce, where protecting customer privacy is crucial. If models are trained on private data, additional concerns arise if such models are made publicly available. LLMs tend to memorize phrases from their training sets, which an adversary could exploit to extract sensitive data, posing a threat to personal privacy [481, 482]. Real-Time Processing: Real-time processing in Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) is pivotal for various applications, especially with the rising popularity of mobile AI applications and concerns regarding information security and privacy. However, LLMs often have hundreds of layers and millions of parameters, which impede real-time processing due to the high computational demands and limited weight storage on hardware platforms, particularly in edge computing environ- ments [483]. While certain e fforts like MobileBERT aim to reduce memory requirements, they still face substantial execution overhead due to the large number of model layers, leading to high",

            "passage": "that issues of privacy were brought along from Europe. The ownership or possession of land in the New World furnished a secure base for the privilege of privacy. Because of the distance between homesteads, in the view of David Flaherty [4], physical privacy became a characteristic of everyday life, and the home itself became the primary place of privacy. The home is still seen in that way since the home is a personal castle, which emphasizes the idea that privacy is related to wealth. Historically, poverty and the home meant less privacy, particularly where families share common dwellings with almost no physical separation. Nowadays it is generally accepted that everybody has a need for privacy, although the way it is appreciated differs from culture to culture and from person to person. At the same time it is clear that a need for privacy can never be absolute and must be balanced against other needs, for example the need for fighting terrorism, criminality, and fraud. As we will then see, the discussion on privacy primarily is a political discussion about the way the distinct individu al and societal interests can be balanced. 2.2 The Concept of Privacy In the most fundamental form, privacy is related to the most intimate aspects of being human. Throughout history privacy is related to the house, to family life, and to (personal) correspondence. This relation can be seen as a way of controlling a situation. Since the 14 th through the 18th",

In this paper, we start with the need for privacy and attempt to unravel the confusion within that issue. Thereafter, we will give an overview of the concept of privacy, an interpretation of that discussion, and a way of looking at privacy. In addition we will examine the function of privacy in order to clarify the importance of privacy (protection). The third chapter is devoted to the attacks on privacy starting with the first publicly discussed cases in 1361 and then focusing on the development during the 20 th century until the present day. This chapter makes clear how strong the relationship is between privacy discussion and technology, in particular information technology as it is called now. It shows the double face of techno logy, which can help people to master problems and simultaneously can influence people and their conduct in a negative way. An example of these technologies is the Radio Frequency Identity (RFID). As a pacemaker, the RFID is helpful but as a chip under the skin it can become a tool for tracing all movement of an individual. Another example is ambient technologies which will be present in almost all households in the Western hemisphere. For some time, there have been ways to protect privacy. In many countries, this protection is included in a country’s constitution, and in some cases privacy protection is",
