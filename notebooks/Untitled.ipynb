In this context, the purpose of this review is to summarize and to understand through the analysis of scientific researches , the benefits and risks of caffeine consumption on human body. According to literature, caffeine can be be neficial when it is taken in moderat e amount of dosage by healthy adults (<450 mg /day), or harmful to human health when it is consumed in high doses (> 450 mg/day ). In this case , it contributes to the development of diverse physiological changes, mainly rel ated to the nervous, cardiovascular and renal systems . In addition, it is important to take into account that the adverse eff ects of caffeine on the body varies according to weight, gender , age, the use of certain kinds of medications and the differences i n sensitivity including hypertensive people and diabetic people . Nonetheless, future research es are needed to add ress further information to these emerging concerns in order to provide a greater empirical support for the caffeine consumption recommendation s.

In this context, the purpose of this review is to summarize and to understand through the analysis of scientific researches , the benefits and risks of caffeine consumption on human body. According to literature, caffeine can be be neficial when it is taken in moderat e amount of dosage by healthy adults (<450 mg /day), or harmful to human health when it is consumed in high doses (> 450 mg/day ). In this case , it contributes to the development of diverse physiological changes, mainly rel ated to the nervous, cardiovascular and renal systems . In addition, it is important to take into account that the adverse eff ects of caffeine on the body varies according to weight, gender , age, the use of certain kinds of medications and the differences i n sensitivity including hypertensive people and diabetic people . Nonetheless, future research es are needed to add ress further information to these emerging concerns in order to provide a greater empirical support for the caffeine consumption recommendation s.
